# Airlines-Analytics-BySarthak
I deploy tech tools like MS Excel, SQL , Python (pandas , matplotlib , Numpy) to analyse the operation of Airlines and improvement needed.

The end goal of this task would be to identify opportunities to increase the
occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increased
profitability for the airline
